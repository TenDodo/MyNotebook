    <h1>Why use Linux</h1>
    <p>An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. So the question is: why should I use Linux?</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Reasons why use Linux</h1>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/">r/linuxmasterrace</a> some reasons are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Less malware than OSX and Windows.</li>
      <li>It's faster and more efficient than OSX and Windows.</li>
      <li>No bloatware included.</li>
      <li>You can make your desktop look however you want. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">Literally</a>.</li>
      <li>You can update all your computer's software with a single click.</li>
      <li>Runs on pretty much anything, no matter how old it is.</li>
      <li>You can see every line of code it uses, so you know there's no NSA backdoor. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/09/19/linux_backdoor_intrigue/">They tried (and failed) to get a backdoor inserted into Linux</a>. There are also no keyloggers built-in, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-windows-technical-preview-data,27816.html">unlike in Windows</a></li>
      <li>It costs exactly $0.</li>
      <li>According to Gabe Newell, it's the future of PC gaming (as is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown">SteamOS</a>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Is Linux for everyone?</h1>
    <p>Yes and no. Using Linux is not as scary as many people make it out to be. In some distributions you don't even need to use a terminal, although it is very helpful to use it. However, if you want to use this system efficiently, you need to learn the basic commands and how the directory structure works on this system. So if you have a hard time learning new things related to computers this system is definitely not for you.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Whether linux is for you or not</h1>
    <p>You should give Linux a chance if you:</p>
    <ul class="disc-list">
      <li>Care about your own privacy.</li>
      <li>Want lightweight, fully functional os.</li>
      <li>Want your system to be <b>YOURS</b> and you can do whatever you want in it.</li>
      <li>Don't want to have unnecessary things on your computer that you won't use anyway.</li>
      <li>Want to have full control of your computer.</li>
      <li>Want to have everything for free.</li>
      <li>Want to give a "new life" to old computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Linux is not for you if you:</p>
    <ul class="disc-list">
      <li>Want a full support for non open-source, not designed for Linux programs (Like Adobe Photoshop, Visual Studio, etc.).</li>
      <li>Have a hard time learning things related to computers.</li>
      <li>Want everything to just work (even if it works out of your control).</li>
    </ul>
